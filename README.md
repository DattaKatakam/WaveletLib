# WaveletLib
This library generates the waves of different types like sine, cosine, square, fourier, toothsaw, random noise signal, cwt (continous wavelet transform), also performs DFT ( direct fourier tranform) on waves. Mainly Vectors are used in this whole concept since interface is QT, so i used Qvectors.
To use the library add any of the lib file in release folder, .a or .o or .dll in make file, and header of the library.
If you couldn't add library then include or add .cpp in your project and use them accordingly.
